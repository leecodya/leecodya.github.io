				<h4><b>Career Goals</b></h4>
				<p>In the short term, my current professional goals are quite simple: meet the demands of current clients with excellence, and obtain a leadership role in a growing organization. My first priority is graduating in December with a Bachelors Degree in Information Technology. I can only move up in the world from there. The second is to obtain a position within a company that would not only allow but encourage me to further develop and sharpen the skills I have now.</p>
				<p>Overall, my career goals are to be a successful web developer: to create dynamic web applications for businesses that are seeking assistance in creating websites and maintain a working database. I would ultimately like to create my own CMS and be able to create websites and databases within the CMS, whether as part of a project or for freelancing purposes.</p>

				<h4><b>Learning Goals</b></h4>
				<p>I would like to learn anything I possibly can about web development and database implementation. I want to learn the many different languages and ways to create clean, responsive websites that are not only easy on the eyes but gives the user an excellent experience. I want to know what it would actually take to make my own CMS and to be able to make it function as designed; to learn the ins and outs of implementing a database into any website I make, if necessary, that would conform to the needs and wants of the client on hand.I am aware of the task at hand. In order to achieve this level of knowledge in my field, I must continue to grow as an academic through gaining certifactions and enrolling in new online courses.</p>

				<h4><b>Professional Development</b></h4>
				<p>Professional Development I believe is key when talking about becoming a success. If you want to make it in this world, especially in the field of IT, there should not be a day that goes by that you haven’t learned something new. It doesn’t always have to be within in a certain field. People fail to realize that you can keep the mind sharp by just simply reading a magazine or a few pages of a favorite book. Personally, I am always looking to improve and become better than the day before.</p>

				<h4><b>Avenues for Professional Development</b></h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Become more involved in out-of-class projects.</li>
					<li>Ask around work to see if there are any new features to be added that I yet can’t do.</li>
					<li>Reread new textbooks and go over my past notes and journal remarks as a refresher.</li>
					<li>Subscribe to online content sources, such as Udemy and Treehouse. They have plenty of online courses that will surely either expand pre-existing knowledge about a subject or teach you something new.</li>

				<h4><b>Professional Development Plan</b></h4>
				<p>As of right now, the plan in achieving this starts with continuing my education. Since I am currently in a position that will allow me to learn and expand my skillset, I am going to continue to work upon graduating in December with my Bachelor’s. While working, I will continue to learn new things outside of work via online courses and freelancing. After graduation, I will take some time off from school to focus on work, further developing my knowledge, and gaining new experiences before starting a Master’s program in IT. </p>

				<h4><b>Strengths</b></h4>
				<p>My strengths are web design languages, particularly HTML, CSS, SQL, Responsive Design (Bootstrap), and most ASP.NET with some C# to coincide with .NET platform. I have worked with WordPress before for a former client. I am easy to work with. If I don’t know something that you want me to do, I have no trouble reaching out for help whenever I can’t figure something out. I have always considered myself a team player.</p>

				<h4><b>Opportunities</b></h4>
				<p>The opportunities that are there for me at this point are online courses that I can either buy for myself or view for free. I already have a couple courses saved that I would like to dive into once I graduate and/or have extra free time and learn more about. A few of those courses include PHP and JavaScript because I know those are near vital languages to learn if I want to be successful in my career path. I firmly believe gaining a mentor/coach would really benefit me and my learning.</p>
